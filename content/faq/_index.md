## SadatRocks looks awesome. Who is it for?

I designed SadatRocks as a small and inconspicuous helper for my professional developers and designers portfolio Site. It is
built on <samp>Kube</samp> Framework <code>version 6.5.2</code> by <em>IMPERAVI</em>. It was designed to help me keeping my routine tasks to a minimum. For those who know HTML/CSS/JS inside out, SadatRocks may become an irreplaceable tool that saves countless hours of work.

If you are new to HTML/CSS/JS, then you may have a hard time implementing SadatRocks in your projects, and it may just not be a tool for you yet. But certainly feel free to download and explore SadatRocks, and see where this journey will take you!

## Isn’t it a great idea to add some awesome features to SadatRocks?

Nope. I wanted to keep SadatRocks minimalistic, small and flexible. So, actually, there’s more chance of me removing stuff from the code and functions while preserving features, than adding new code and new stuff.

## What Does the Future Hold for SadatRocks? What’s the plan?

Having this said, I am keeping my eyes on what’s new in the world of HTML, CSS, and JS, and if something truly exciting happens in future with these technologies (comparable, let’s say, to flexbox emergence), I most certainly will consider these changes and will be first to go ahead and implement them as soon as possible.

## How do I migrate from an older version to the latest one?

Basically, you take the new SadatRocks and start afresh from scratch.
